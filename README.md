# FlashPicker

iOS 10 Messages app like quick image picker.

## Requirements

Swift 2.0, iOS 8.0

## Installation

It's recommended to use CocoaPods.

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects.

CocoaPods 0.36 adds supports for Swift and embedded frameworks. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate MonkeyKing into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'FlashPicker'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

You should open the `{Project}.xcworkspace` instead of the `{Project}.xcodeproj` after you installed anything from CocoaPods.

For more information about how to use CocoaPods, I suggest [this tutorial](http://www.raywenderlich.com/64546/introduction-to-cocoapods-2).
